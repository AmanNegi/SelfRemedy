# Self Remedy
## Inspiration 🎨
I took the inspiration for this app from Wikipedia, GitHub, and majorly open-source. I looked at how we use open-source projects in our daily lives, and how all of the people collectively make it happen. As our theme was Health and Wellness, I developed an educational and contributable application where one can learn about diseases and find some basic details about them, and meanwhile, professionals or people having knowledge can keep it up to date.

## What it does 😬
The app can be used for Educational as well as for basic medical purposes. One can learn about the diseases meanwhile a sick person can find some help. The users, themselves can edit or add the information. In case a user is unable to find some disease he/she can add it themselves, meanwhile can add onto it by editing it.

## How we built it 💪
We built it using Flutter and for the backend we used AppWrite. The design for the application was done in Figma. So basically the tech stack is:
- Flutter
- AppWrite
- Figma

You can find the APK file [here](https://github.com/AmanNegi/self_remedy/blob/main/releases/app-release.apk).

## Challenges we ran into 😫
- In such platforms, it is hard to ensure that the data entered is valid and decent or not, for this, we added a report button. The admin can then check and remove the reported information.
- At first, figuring out AppWrite took some time, but the docs helped a lot.
- Creating the starting animation was a task in itself.
- The Edit Page for properties that are stored as a list, was really time-consuming.

In the end, due to patience and hard work, I was able to make this app in time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This is my *first hackathon* and I worked solo, so everything seemed hard as everything was new for me. However, the community helped me with my doubts. I was able to research, create designs, gather information, and learn to integrate the app with AppWrite in just 2 days, I guess that is an accomplishment 😅. 

## What we learned 📖
- Learned to Integrate the app with AppWrite.
- Used Figma to generate simple logos and illustrations.
- Explored more into Flutter and animations.

## What's next for Self Remedy 🌐
This is just a starting point for this application. Further, we can create an admin panel where we can easily delete useless information or block reported users.
